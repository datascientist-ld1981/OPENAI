PDF-Based Q&A System using OpenAI, FAISS, and LangChain
Overview
This project is designed to extract textual content from PDFs and enable question-answering (Q&A) functionality using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS vector search. The system efficiently retrieves relevant document sections based on user queries, providing contextual answers.

Key Features
✅ PDF Text Extraction – Extracts content from research papers, reports, and other PDFs.
✅ Embedding-based Search – Converts document text into vector embeddings for fast similarity search.
✅ Contextual Q&A – Uses OpenAI’s LLM to generate answers based on retrieved document chunks.
✅ Efficient Retrieval – Utilizes FAISS for optimized text search, ensuring relevant information is fetched.
✅ Streamlit Interface – Simple UI for user-friendly interaction with the document.

Why These Tools?
Tool	Purpose
OpenAI (Embeddings & Chat Models)	Converts text into vector embeddings and generates responses from retrieved text chunks.
LangChain	Streamlines the integration of LLMs, embedding models, and retrieval mechanisms.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)	Efficiently searches for similar text chunks based on embeddings, enabling quick and accurate retrieval.
pdfplumber	Extracts text from PDFs, making them searchable.
Streamlit	Provides a web interface for users to upload PDFs and ask questions.
Project Workflow
1️⃣ Upload a PDF – The user uploads a research paper or document.
2️⃣ Extract Text – The system extracts textual content using pdfplumber.
3️⃣ Create Embeddings – Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI.
4️⃣ Indexing with FAISS – FAISS stores these embeddings for fast retrieval.
5️⃣ User Query Processing – When a user asks a question, LangChain retrieves the most relevant text chunks.
6️⃣ Answer Generation – OpenAI’s GPT model generates a response based on retrieved chunks.

Installation & Usage
1. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install openai langchain streamlit faiss-cpu pdfplumber
2. Set Up API Key
Create an .env file and add your OpenAI API key:

makefile
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
3. Run the Application
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Example Use Case
A researcher uploads a sentiment analysis research paper and asks:
💬 "What models are compared in this study?"
🔍 The system finds relevant text from the document and generates an answer:
📝 "The paper compares Naive Bayes, LSTM, RNN, BERT, and GPT for sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset."

Future Enhancements
🚀 Support for Multiple PDFs – Allowing queries across multiple documents.
📊 Better Chunking Techniques – Dynamic chunking to improve retrieval efficiency.
🗂 Metadata-Based Search – Using document structure (titles, sections) for better search relevance.
